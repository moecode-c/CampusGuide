            <li>Your phone number, used to reach you about your account</li>
            <li>Your academic year</li>
            <li>Your password, stored only as a bcrypt hash — never as text, and not readable by anyone including the admin</li>

            your midterm marks and any team posts you wrote.

        <Section icon={<Eye className="h-5 w-5" />} title="What is recorded as you use it">
          <p>
            An activity log records meaningful actions — signing in, registering, an admin approving
            or banning an account, files being added or removed — together with the IP address the
            request came from. It is not a log of every page you visit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your account also keeps the time you were last active and the address and browser you
            last used it from. That exists so the admin can spot an account being shared or broken
            into, and it is only ever the most recent value, not a history of where you have been.
          </p>
          <p>
            Failed sign-in attempts are recorded too. That is how the site notices somebody trying to
            guess a password.

        <Section icon={<Lock className="h-5 w-5" />} title="Who can see it">
          <p>
            Other students see only what you deliberately publish: a team post, with the name and
            contact number you put on it. Nothing else about you is visible to them — not your email,
            your marks, your attendance or your timetable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site administrator can see account details and the activity log, because approving
            students and dealing with abuse is not possible otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your attendance figures and marks are yours alone. They are not shared with the
            university, and they are not official records.

        <Section icon={<Server className="h-5 w-5" />} title="Where it lives">
          <p>
            Account and course data are held in a MongoDB Atlas database. Files in the resources
            drive are stored on Cloudflare R2. Both are third-party hosting providers and neither is
            run by the university.

            Signing in sets one cookie holding a signed session token. It lasts up to{" "}
            {SESSION_REMEMBER_DAYS} days depending on whether you ticked &ldquo;remember me&rdquo;.
            There is no advertising, no analytics and no third-party tracking on this site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Videos are embedded from YouTube on its no-cookie domain, which means YouTube does not
            set tracking cookies unless you actually press play on a video.

            Your account and everything attached to it stays until it is deleted. Deleting an account
            removes its personal data along with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Team posts are not removed automatically. The admin clears out posts older than{" "}
